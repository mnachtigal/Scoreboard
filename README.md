# Scoreboard
Scorebaord program that inherits IScoreboard.h to determine the score of a game given a number of periods. 

We felt the design approach that we took was the most appropriate because the
functions are short, and we only have ones that are useful to simulate
playing a game. This design makes it versatile for all different kinds of games.
